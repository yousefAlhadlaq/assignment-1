## 🧠 AI Usage Summary

I used **ChatGPT** and **Cursor** during development:  
- AI generated the initial HTML/CSS structure and suggested improvements.  
- I modified the code using my own knowledge from lectures (e.g., forms, images).  
- Full details are documented in [`docs/ai-usage-report.md`](docs/ai-usage-report.md).
