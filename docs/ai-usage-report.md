# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** – used for generating starter HTML and CSS, debugging, and explanations.  
- **Cursor** – used as an editor with AI assistance for structure and styling.

## Use Cases
- Generated parts of the HTML skeleton for the portfolio.  
- Created CSS styling by referencing a design idea.  
- Asked for explanations about commands and Git/GitHub usage.  

## Benefits
- Made it much easier and faster to set up the project structure.  
- Helped me enhance my skills in using AI tools and understanding how they work.  
- Improved my confidence in writing commands in the terminal (making directories, committing, and pushing code).  

## Challenges
- Sometimes the AI generated a lot of code that I did not fully understand at first.  
- Occasionally, the AI suggestions were wrong or didn’t work as expected.  

## How I Modified AI Suggestions
- I used my own knowledge from lectures to adjust the code.  
- For example, I manually edited forms, images, and other basic elements instead of relying only on AI.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved communication with AI tools and learned how to guide them better.  
- Gained practical experience with Git commands (`git commit`, `git push`, directory creation).  
- Understood more about project structure and how to combine AI suggestions with class knowledge.  
- Learned skills beyond the lectures, such as how to use AI responsibly and how to check AI output critically.  

## Reflection
I feel confident that I know everything in **HTML** and **JavaScript**, but **CSS is still difficult for me**.  
Using AI gave me extra help with CSS and styling, which is not fully covered in lectures. This made me realize CSS is the area I need to practice more, while I am already strong in HTML and JavaScript.
